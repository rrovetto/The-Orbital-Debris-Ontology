### Ontology Description
ODO is an ontology of the orbital debris or space debris domain [1]. It contains classes of the types of orbital debris as well as classes and relations of relevant and related orbital entities. 
<br><br> 
The purpose and goals of ODO (and related ontologies by the author) are (i) to offer formal models of the domain, (ii) generic terminilogies and taxonomies, (iii) foster data-sharing and fusion among space debris and space object catalogues, (iv) help ameliorate the orbital debris problem, and (v) contribute to the philosophy and formal ontology of the domain.
<br><br>
Given the inevitable need to include related concepts from a the broader orbital space domain, ODO is subject to merger, name-change, revision of scope/domain-demarcation. For example, ODO may become the Orbital Ontology 

### Status
Under development as circumstances permit. The ontology creator seeks an funded opportunity to sustainable develop ODO, as well as collaborators/partners.
