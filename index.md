### Description
ODO is an ontology of orbital/space debris [1]. It contains categories of orbital debris as well as categories and non-categorical relations for relevant and related orbital domain  entities. These ontology constructs are defined in natural langauge, and in computable formalisms. 
<br><br> 
Some purposes for ODO (and related ontologies by the author) are (i) to offer formal knowledge representaiton models of the target domain, (ii) to offer generic terminologies, taxonomies, and classifications of space debris objects, (iii) to support AI and MBSE applications for orbital debris data, (iv) to improve orbital debris data organization and management, (v) to potentially foster data-sharing and fusion among space debris and space object catalogues, (vi) to help ameliorate the orbital debris problem, (vii) to contribute to terminological issues in the space policy, law and overall space domain, and (viii) develop and contribute to the philosophy and formal ontology of the domain.
<br><br> ODO is part of a [broader project](https://ontospace.wordpress.com) to create a suite of ontologies for the space domain.

### Status
- In-progress, unfunded but actively open to formal support. Under development as circumstances permit. 
- The ontology creator seeks an funded opportunity to sustainable develop ODO, as well as formal work collaborations and partnerships.
- Given the need to include related concepts from a the broader orbital space domain, ODO is subject to merger, name-change, revision of scope/domain-demarcation. For example, ODO may become the Orbital Ontology.
