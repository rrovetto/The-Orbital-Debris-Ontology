# The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO)
The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO)[1] is a computational ontology representing orbital debris in orbit about Earth or any central body.  It represents orbital objects, more broadly, the relationships between them and the orbited body or bodies. The orbital debris domain involves observation, detection, identificaiton, tracking and propogation (predition of future behavior or motion) of objects in space (part of space situational awareness).

## Purpose
* To support remediation of the orbital debris hazard by contributing to data and AI applications
* To facilitate data-sharing and integration among orbital debris and space object catalogues
* To stimulate international cooperation among SSA communities
* To formally reprsent orbital debris entities
* To continue my studies of astronautical topics
...in order to help ensure global orbital space safety and security of Earth and space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.).

## Status & Access
* In-progress, subject to revision. No claims to completeness.
* As a personal unfunded project since inception, funding/sponsors and work collaborations or a PhD study opportunity are needed to continue, complete and sustain development and realize the project vision. Contact rrovetto@terpalum.umd.edu with opportunities, offers, and work collaborations interest. 
* Donations are welcome. SEEKING patrons, sponsors, employer support, grants, funding, etc. 
* Professors interested in applying to grants with me should contact my email below; Stuentship for this as a PhD 

## Desiderata (How you can help)
* Sponsorship, a PhD studentsthip, or employment opportunity is needed to develop this work.
* Professors--please invite me to be a PhD student. 
* Mentors, a Team, and partnerships to continue development
* Co-authors on related papers
* Technical services to develop hosting, search, visualiation, and other functionalities
* Users of the ontology
* Datasets to apply the ontology
[Or Contact via email](mailto:rrovetto@terpalum.umd.edu) if you are interested in helping with this ontology or the broader project. 

## CONTEXT / EFFORTS 
This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived of the concept (verification documents available upon request). Since then I've been searching for an opportunity (employment, PhD fellowship, research position, researcher-training network, a team, etc.) to sustainably develop and implement this ontology in a collaborative mentored and educational environment with professionals in astrodynamics, astroinformatics, AI, and ontology engineering. I have developed enough paper cocepts on this to make it a PhD project.

## A Note on Domain-Demarcation
Given that the name focuses on orbital debris, a generalization will allow ODO classes to be part of or imported into a broader ontology: e.g., an Orbital Space Ontology[3][4], Orbital Object Ontology, Space Situational Awareness Ontology [2], etc. See my other repositories. The demarcation of ODO and my related ontologies is under development, and the overall ontology suite subject to revision.
