# The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO)
The Orbital Debris Ontology (ODO)[1], by [Robert J. Rovetto](https://github.com/rrovetto), is a computational ontology and conceptual model for orbital debris data, and about the debris in orbit about Earth or any central body. It thereby offers a generic space debris model that can be applied to specific celestial bodies and data sources thereof, and specialized accordingly. With collected datasets, it provides a knowledge graph.

## Description
_See also the Ontology Requirements Specification Document (purchase link coming soon)._

### Scope
ODO represents orbital objects, their characteristics, the relationships between them and the orbited body or bodies, relevant activities (e.g., remediation, mitigation, etc.). The orbital debris domain involves observation, detection, identificaiton, tracking and propogation (predition of future behavior or motion), and removal of objects in orbit. As such it is part of [space situational awareness](https://github.com/rrovetto/space-situational-awareness-domain-ontology)[2]. Given the overlap with other space-related topics, content in ODO may be part of other models by the author and thereby part of the overall set of ontologies under construction. 

### ### Architecture
A self-contained module, usable by itself, but also part of the author's wider [space domain knowledge modeling](https://purl.org/space-ontology) suite of ontologies and other knowledge organization systems.

### Purpose & Value
* To support remediation of orbital debris hazards by contributing to data management, interoperability where desired, and AI applications
* To facilitate data-sharing, integration, and fusion among orbital debris and space object catalogues, where desired
* To stimulate international cooperation among SSA communities by providing a model (and development approach) that may be neutral and applicable to all communities
* To formally reprsent orbital debris entities and relevant content
* To support data and content search and retrieval among relevant domain content (documents, data, etc.) 
* To explore the utility of ontology and various applications
* To continue my studies of astronautical topics
...in order to help ensure global orbital space safety and security of Earth and space-borne assetts (satellites, etc.).

### Status
* In-progress as circumstances permit. Subject to revision. 
* As a unfunded personal project since inception, continued development is dependent on circumstances. Formal support is needed to complete and sustain development to realize the full project vision. The vision is ambitious, multidisciplinary and detailed. [Contact the author](https://ontospace.wordpress.com/contact) to formally support the project in some way. Donations are welcome at the below web-links.  
* ACTIVELY NEEDING: financial support, employer support, stable environment with resources to development and continue learning, etc.
* Desired as my PhD or other graduate project

## Support / Contribute / Desiderata - How you can help 
As an unfunded personal project, you can help by offerring financial support, employment opportunities, graduate study opportunities whereby this can be part of my thesis or projects, co-authorship on papers or proposal, mentorship, voluntary technical expertise/servies for desired functionalities of my project, relevant datasets to apply the ontology to, and to be a user of the ontology(s).

## Context / History
This has been a pursuit since 2011, when I conceived of the concept (verification documents available upon request). It's been my hopeful entry to the space sector. Since then I've been searching for opportunities (employment, PhD fellowship, researcher-training networks, a team, etc.) to sustainably develop and implement this ontology while continuing studies in space topics (a passion). I have hoped to do so in a stable, safe, educational environment with professionals in relevant topics (astrodynamics, astroinformatics, AI, etc.), and I've developed enough paper cocepts on this to make it a PhD project.

## Access
* Contact if interested in purchasing use 
* With sufficient formal support, the ontology may become open 

## A Note on Domain Demarcation
Given that the name focuses on orbital debris, a generalization will allow ODO classes to be part of or imported into a broader ontology: e.g., an Orbital Space Ontology[3], Orbital Object Ontology, Space Situational Awareness Ontology[2], etc. See my other [repositories](https://github.com/rrovetto?page=2&tab=repositories). The demarcation of ODO and my related ontologies is under development, and the overall ontology suite subject to revision.
